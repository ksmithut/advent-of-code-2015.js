# Advent of Code

This is my repo for keeping track of my answers for [advent of code][advent].
This is setup for questions to be answered using JavaScript, specifically in the
[node][node] environment.

You must have `node` installed on your machine, and it must be version 6 or
later. If you are using [`nvm`][nvm], you can run `nvm install && nvm use` while
in the directory of this project.

To run a day's code, run `npm start [day]`. For example, if you wish to run
`day01/`, you run `npm start 1` or `npm start 01` or `npm start day01`. You can
run multiple days. If you wish to run all of the days, run `npm start *`.

All of the inputs are set to my inputs. Change those for you as needed. You may
also need to change the answers, but the example inputs and answers should stay
the same. You can add to/remove from those examples as needed to test your
cases.
